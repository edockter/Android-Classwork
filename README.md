# IUPUI CIT30500 - Android Classwork
### In-class changes 3/1:

* Changed SingleFragmentActivity's onNavigationItemSelected() method.  Uses the FragmentManager to change fragments when a menu item is selected.
* Added an icon resource.  Icon resources can be added by:
  1. Right-click "res" folder.
  1. Select New -> Vector Asset.
  1. Change name if desired (probably best not to).
  1. Click Icon button to change icon.
* We need to change the icons on our menu to things that make sense.  Your choice!
* We talked about using the Iconify library to display icons from icon fonts (like FontAwesome, IonIcons, etc) in an easy way.  Will probably end up doing this.
